## üìå **Project Overview**

**Cloud at AI Sky** is a research-driven project that optimizes resource management in cloud computing environments. By modeling the cloud as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)**, the project implements **Dynamic Programming-driven Admission Control** to prioritize high-revenue Virtual Machine (VM) deployments. Additionally, it employs **Greedy and Randomized Algorithms** for efficient load balancing, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

This project is inspired by the research paper:  
Feldman, Zohar & Masin, Michael & Tantawi, Asser & Arroyo, Diana & Steinder, Malgorzata. (2011). Using Approximate Dynamic Programming to Optimize Admission Control in Cloud Computing Environment. Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference. 10.1109/WSC.2011.6148014.

## üöÄ **Key Features**

### 1. **Markov Decision Process (MDP) Modeling**
- The cloud environment is modeled as an MDP to capture dynamic resource allocation and deployment decisions.
- States represent the current configuration of VM deployments across nodes, while actions determine whether to admit or reject incoming deployment requests.

### 2. **Dynamic Programming-Driven Admission Control**
- Utilizes the **Bellman Equation** to derive optimal admission policies.
- Prioritizes high-revenue VM deployments by maximizing long-term expected revenue.
- Accounts for resource constraints and deployment lifetimes.

### 3. **Load Balancing with Greedy or Randomized Algorithms**
- Ensures efficient resource utilization across nodes.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Allocates resources to the most underutilized nodes.
- **Randomized Algorithm:** Distributes workloads randomly to prevent overloading specific nodes.

## üß¨ **Methodology**

### 1. **Problem Formulation**
- The cloud environment is modeled as a Continuous-Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP).
- States capture the current configuration of VM deployments, including pending requests and resource utilization.
- Actions determine whether to admit or reject incoming deployment requests.

### 2. **Dynamic Programming for Admission Control**
- The **Bellman Equation** is used to compute the value function for each state.
- Optimal policies are derived by maximizing the expected long-term revenue.

### 3. **Load Balancing Strategies**
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Allocates resources to nodes with the most available capacity.
- **Randomized Algorithm:** Distributes workloads randomly to ensure fairness and prevent bottlenecks.

## üìä **Results and Impact**

### 1. **Optimal Admission Policies**
- Achieves **higher revenue margins** by prioritizing high-revenue VM deployments.
- Reduces **lost opportunities** by efficiently managing resource allocation.

### 2. **Efficient Load Balancing**
- Ensures **balanced resource utilization** across nodes.
- Prevents **resource fragmentation** and overloading of specific nodes.
